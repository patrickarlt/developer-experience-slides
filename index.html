# What Makes a Great Developer Service?
<br>
Great developer services help developers build better apps.

They do this by solving problems for developers.

Do something developers don't want to do on their own.

Own your problem space.<br>
Be the best at solving **YOUR** problem.

Developers will use your service because it lets then focus on <br>
devivering the best products for **THEIR** users and customers

# What problems can Esri solve for developers?

## Mapping
<br>
Developers don't want to make their own maps <br>
and mapping systems unless they have to

[Map](img/map.png)

## Geocoding and Place Search
<br>
Geocoding is hard. Developers don't want to do this on their own<br>
Esri can make it easy to geocode addresses.

[Geocode](img/geocoding.png)

## Directions
<br>
Directions from point A to B takes more work then you think.<br>
Esri can make it easy for developers to get directions

[Directions](img/dir.png)

## Context
<br>
Esri had mountains of data about places, tapestry, income, demographics<br>
Developers will think of new and interesting ways to use that data

## Geotriggers
<br>
Mobile developers want to script events to happen at certain places<br>
but they don't want to think about how to do it

## Data Storage
<br>
Esri has tools for storing and querying geographic data<br>
Lets give developers a solution to storing rich geographic data

# Principles When Designing For Developers

## 5 Minute Win
<br>
Developers should be able to use your<br> product to do **SOMETHING** within 5 minutes
<ul>
    <li>Provide sample code</li>
    <li>Getting started tutorials</li>
    <li>Full and complete documentation</li>
</ul>

[Parse Getting Started](img/parse-guides.png)

[Parse Sample Code](img/parse-samples.png)

[Stripe Docs](img/stripe.png)

## Dont Waste Developers Time
* Short signup process
* Get back writing code ASAP

[Github Signup](img/github-signup.png)

[Github Onboarding](img/github-onbarding.png)

## Show Dont Tell
<br>
Don't **TELL** me your service can do something
<br>
**SHOW** me your service can do something

[Twilio Demos](img/twilio-demos.png)

Don't **TELL** it's easy
<br>
**SHOW** me  it's easy

[Heroku Home Page](heroku-sample-code.png)

## Progressive Disclosure
<br>
Developers don't care if your service can do A,B,C,D,X,Y,Z.

They just want to use it for C

Solve their problem first then show them more features they can use...

[Heroku How It Works Page](img/heroku-hosting.png)

Solve the problem of hosting first...

Then show what else you can do...

[Heroku Addons](img/heroku-addons.png)

## Documentation IS Marketing
<br>
Documentation is a metric of how good a service is

### Is your documentation...
* Well written?
* Well organized?
* Written in plain english? - no marketing or special terms

## Don't Sell
<br>
Your product is not simple, easy to use, or the best

Talk about your product **DOES**

Developers will tell other develoeprs how good it is

## APIs are the new UIs
<br>
Devlopers want APIs to build with

[LEGO](img/lego.jpg)

Not user interfaces to interact with

Design is how it works not what it looks like

### Lightbulb Test

How many lines of code does it take to ________________?

make a map on a web page?

get directions form A to B?

If you don't enjoy using your own system you're doing to wrong

Start designing APIs the same way you<br>
would a wireframe or a user interface

Think about what developers need to accomplish

And the simplest way for them to accomplish it

# How developers find your product

[Google](img/google.png)

1. Google for how to do something
2. Your product or a post about it comes up

[Stack Overflow](img/stackoverflow.png)

1. Ask a question about how to do something
2. Answer is your product

[Blogs and News](img/hacker-new.png)

1. Someone posts about how they did X,Y,Z
2. They used your product
3. Someone else needs to do X,Y,Z
3. They use your product

[Your Docs](img/search.png)

1. Someone Searches for "geocoding api"
2. Your documentation comes up

# In All These cases
<br>
Developers want something to solve their **specific** problem<br>
Not a general system or solution


# What can you do now?

### Learn to code

[Code academy](img/codecademy-01-700x477.jpg)

### Go to events

[http://www.meetup.com/](img/meetup.png)

### Listen

* Developers give great and specific feedback
* If people complain it's because they are using your product

# Questsions
* [Slides](http://patrickarlt.github.com/developer-experience-slides)
